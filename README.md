## About The Project

In today's volatile market, making informed economic decisions is more challenging
than ever. This project, the AI Economy Forecaster, was inspired by the need for 
accessible and intelligent tools to predict economic trends.

### The Problem

Traditional economic forecasting models are often complex, require deep expertise, 
and may not be able to process the vast amounts of real-time data available today. 
This creates a barrier for individuals and small businesses to make data-driven decisions.

### The Solution

The AI Economy Forecaster leverages the power of Google's Generative AI to analyze
economic data and provide users with easy-to-understand forecasts and insights. 
Our goal is to democratize economic forecasting and empower users to navigate 
the economy with confidence.

## Features

*   **AI-Powered Predictions:** Utilizes generative AI to provide economic forecasts.
*   **Interactive Charts:** Visualizes economic data and predictions for better understanding.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive UI built with React, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS.
